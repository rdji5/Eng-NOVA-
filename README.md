**This documentation showcases the design, engineering, and programming stages of our Future Engineers category vehicle. It was designed to avoid obstacles and navigate and pivot smoothly. Our journey focused on addressing complex engineering challenges through custom mechanical solutions and effective sensor strategies.
We relied on Ackermann Steering Geometry to achieve precise, smooth, and slip-free cornering, meeting the competition's requirement of using only a single DC motor for propulsion. A rear-wheel drive (RWD) system was chosen, featuring a single DC motor connected to a mechanical differential, to reduce programming complexity and ensure balanced weight distribution.**
