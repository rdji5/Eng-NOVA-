# **Part 1: About Us**

## **This is our team**

We are three students from Hebron, Palestine, and we belong to the Programming and Artificial Intelligence clubs under the guidance of our coach, Abeer Al-Jabari. Our team was established with our participation in the Future Engineer program on September 1st. We have also previously participated in programming and STEM clubs.


## **Team name**
The name “NOVA” represents a new star that suddenly shines with renewed energy — symbolizing innovation, brilliance, and growth. It reflects our team’s spirit of creativity and ambition, as we strive to illuminate the field of engineering and technology with fresh ideas that drive progress and inspire excellence.

Despite our different ages and personal interests, we share a common passion: a love for technology and robotics, and a continuous desire to learn and improve. This passion drives us to participate in the Future Engineer competition and work together as a team

 We developed an action plan to organize our steps and distribute tasks among team members
It outlines what each person must do and accomplish, and helps us prioritize and track progress
This allows us to work with focus and collaboration, achieving our goals quickly and accurately

 # Our Vision and Goal
 
Our vision is to develop an intelligent robot capable of performing smart commands independently. We aim to build a system that can analyze its surroundings, make decisions, and complete tasks efficiently without direct human control. This project represents our first step toward creating innovative solutions that support our community and inspire future technological advancements
Through this competition, we have gained valuable experience in robotics, programming, and teamwork. We also developed essential skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and planning
In the future, we plan to use what we’ve learned to improve our projects, support younger students, and continue developing technologies that make a positive impact

# Second, define our project
After assembling and designing the robot to meet the competition requirements, we programmed it to rely on Ultrasonic distance sensors alongside the camera.
The Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by sending pulses and calculating their return time, enabling the robot to continuously avoid collisions and adjust its path.
The camera, on the other hand, is responsible for color recognition; for example, if it detects the color red, the data is sent to the Raspberry Pi controller, which determines the robot’s movement according to the programmed algorithms.

#A journey of challenge and adaptation:
When we first started, we had planned to use a vehicle with four DC motors. However, before we could finalize it, we learned of a law requiring fewer than three-quarters of the motors to be DC. This change forced us to build a completely different vehicle, which took a long time. However, we finally got it built and started programming and testing            Click here to see the installation steps --> https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4X3wNT3hZlc 


While assembling the car, we faced a space problem, so we brought a customized base to add a second layer and create more room. In the end, we installed the new base and successfully solved the problem.

We then faced several issues with the codes we used, which forced us to go through a long journey of modifying, testing, then modifying and testing again, especially since this is the first year for the three of us in both WRO and (Future Engineers), which made it more difficult, but the codes and the movement have improved a little over time, and we are confident that it will be ready one way or another for the final competition.

In the end, we achieved a well-structured robot with balanced weight distribution, which helped improve its performance and stability. After assembling it, we successfully programmed it to complete the required tasks efficiently and accurately 

And here is a picture of the final look of the robot after completing its assembly and programming
