Despite our different ages and personal interests, we share a common passion: a love for technology and robotics, and a continuous desire to learn and improve. This passion drives us to participate in the Future Engineer competition and work together as a team

 **Our Vision and Goal**
Our vision is to develop an intelligent robot capable of performing smart commands independently. We aim to build a system that can analyze its surroundings, make decisions, and complete tasks efficiently without direct human control. This project represents our first step toward creating innovative solutions that support our community and inspire future technological advancements
Through this competition, we have gained valuable experience in robotics, programming, and teamwork. We also developed essential skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and planning
In the future, we plan to use what we’ve learned to improve our projects, support younger students, and continue developing technologies that make a positive impact

# Second, define our project
After assembling and designing the robot to meet the competition requirements, we programmed it to rely on Ultrasonic distance sensors alongside the camera.
The Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by sending pulses and calculating their return time, enabling the robot to continuously avoid collisions and adjust its path.
The camera, on the other hand, is responsible for color recognition; for example, if it detects the color red, the data is sent to the Raspberry Pi controller, which determines the robot’s movement according to the programmed algorithms.
